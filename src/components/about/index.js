          The founders of Scrap Management are pioneers and forward-thinking
          professionals in the waste optimization industry. Our main focus is on
          delivering value by diverting plastics from landfills and incineration
          plants. We do this by working with waste producers/consolidators to
          optimize their flow of material. Our expert sales team specializes in
          helping customers minimize costs while maximizing the value of their
          scrap plastics.

        <p className="h5">What We Do</p>
        <p className="lead">
          Scrap Management is a recycling company specializing in Post-Consumer
          & Post-Industrial plastics. We conduct business only with companies
          that operate within the United States. It is our belief that we have
          all the feedstock (scrap material) we need right here in America and
          that we have a duty to find ways to reprocess what has historically
          been exported.
        </p>
        <p className="lead">
          {' '}
          With a highly trained & experienced team of recycling professionals,
          our goal is to streamline how recycling is done. We work with
          processors to understand their needs and abilities then source
          feedstock from unconventional sources to improve diversion and
          eliminate landfill bound scrap.
        </p>
        <p className="lead">
          {' '}
          We strive to educate businesses and residents on what is and isn’t
          recyclable and how to handle different scrap materials to increase
          landfill diversion. Conserving resources is financially smart and
          environmentally responsible. We owe it to our planet to do everything
          we can to recycle our waste and cut down pollution.
